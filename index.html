<h2> Why I love soft toys </h2>

<p> I love soft toys because they make me feel better so when I am mad at my brothors I take
 a soft toy and it comes me down.</p>

<ul>
<li> soft toys are the best because you can cuddle with them a lot! </li>
<li> soft toys are the best because when you sleep you are not scrad because you are with a soft toy!  </li>
<li> soft toys are the best because you can go with them anywere and you can eat with them! </li>
